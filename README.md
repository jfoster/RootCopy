# RootCopy

Copy iOS root directories to the sandboxed storage area (useful for grabbing private framework files)

This project was originally created in ~2016 and rediscovered in early 2019 buried deep in my storage.
It may still serve a purpose but is not actively supported, however, it is donated to the public domain.
